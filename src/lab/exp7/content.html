	    Presence of sulphates in excess of the permissible limits in a foundation soil causes deleterious effects on R.C.C. foundations. Sodium Sulphate is generally in some Indian Soils. This salt is easily hydrated and dehydrated with the climatic variations. The enormous volume changes during  the process of hydration and dehydration , influences the Engineering Properties  of the soils. The sulphate contain and moisture contain of the soil are affected by the seasonal fluctuations and hence mutually interdependent.

		<li>Take 10 g of representative soil from the sample prepared and transfer the same in a dispersion cup. Add 100 ml distilled water to it and fit the cup in the electric stirrer. Stir the solution in the dispersion cup for 30 minutes and leave the suspension undisturbed for about 24 hours</li>
          	<li>Filter the above solution and take 50 ml of the filterate in a beaker. Add a few drops of phenolphthalein indicator and if the extract is found alkaline, pour continuously con. HCl in it just to neutralise the solution .Add further 4 ml con.HCl to make the solution acidic. Heat the solution to boiling.</li>
		<li>Take out the boiling source from the heat source and add hot barium chloride slowly and stir the solution continuously till there is no precipitation by further addition. Now place the beaker on a steam bath for about 4 to 5 hours so that precipitate may settle. Filter the solution using ashless filter paper in a glass funnel. Wash sample in filter paper by adding distilled water continuously till the water coming out of the glass funnel is free from chloride ions. As s check collect the washing in a test tube at different intervals and add a drop of 0.5% silver nitrate solution. The formation of white precipitates indicates the presence of chloride ions in the precipitate. Continue the white process till white precipitates are not formed in the washings by addition of silver nitrate solution.</li>
		<li>Alternatively filteration may also be done using a per-weighed sintered glass crucible or a Gooch crucible.</li>
		<li>In case of filter paper, dry the filter paper containing  precipitates in an oven at 60 degree C for about 2-3 hours. Now keep this filter paper in a pre-weighed silica crucible and ignite the filter paper in a muffle furnace at 700 degree C to 800 degree C for about half an hour. Cool the crucible in a desiccator.</li>
		<li>weigh and note the weight of the residue in it. The difference of weights i.e. the weight of residue is the mass of barium sulphate.</li>
