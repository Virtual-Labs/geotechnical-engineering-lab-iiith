            <p>
            <span class='term'>Expansiveness</span> (also referred to as reactivity) is a phenomenon that affects many clay soils, particularly those that contain significant quantities of smectite clay minerals. In many cases, the shrinking and swelling of expansive clays in response to moisture content change can be a serious cause of damage to buildings.
            </p> <p>
Swelling clays derived from <span class='term'>residual soil</span> can exert uplift pressures of as much as 5,500 PSF, which can do considerable damage to lightly-loaded wood-frame structures. Insurance companies pay out millions of dollars yearly to repair homes distressed by expansive soils. 
 Expansive soils owe their characteristics to the presence of swelling clay minerals. As they get wet, the clay minerals absorb water molecules and expand; conversely, as they dry they shrink, leaving large voids in the soil. Swelling clays can control the behavior of virtually any type of soil if the percentage of clay is more than about 5 percent by weight. Soils with <span class='term'>smectite</span> clay minerals, such as montmorillonite, exhibit the most profound swelling properties. </p> <p>
 Potentially expansive soils can typically be recognized in the lab by their plastic properties. Inorganic clays of high plasticity, generally those with liquid limits exceeding 50 percent and plasticity index over 30, usually have high inherent swelling capacity. Expansion of soils can also be measured in the lab directly, by immersing a remolded soil sample and measuring its volume change. </p> <p>
 In the field, expansive clay soils can be easily recognized in the dry season by the deep cracks, in roughly polygonal patterns, in the ground surface. The zone of seasonal moisture content fluctuation can extend from three to forty feet deep. This creates cyclic shrink/swell behavior in the upper portion of the soil column, and cracks can extend to much  greater depths than imagined by most engineers. </p> <p> 
To overcome this problems swelling index test is conducted .The shrink swell test is a simple test that is routinely employed in <span class='term'>Geotechnical engineering</span> practice to assess quantitatively the expansive potential of undisturbed or remolded clay soils, and to guide design of footings, Retaining walls , underground water tanks  etc., which are subjected to soil pressure.

direction may take place.</li>
